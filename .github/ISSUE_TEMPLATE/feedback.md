(Thanks for taking the time to submit feedback! We've supplied some questions
below to try and help standardise responses, but feel free to skip/delete/amend as you see fit.)

## Initial thoughts

#### Did you have any difficulties getting the prototype demo up and running?

#### Were your initial gut feelings about the prototype direction positive or negative?

## Components

#### Did you like the `@name` folder name convention for components?

#### v1-style 'single file components' are no longer supported. Does that pose any difficulties for you?

#### Do you have any thoughts on the naming of configuration properties?

(For example, v1 'variants' and 'context data' config properties have been renamed to 'scenarios' and 'props' respectively. Are those names better/worse/the same?)

## Adapters

#### Which template engines/frameworks would you most like to see integration with? (2 - 3 max)

[ ] DustJS
[ ] HAML
[ ] Handlebars
[ ] Marko
[ ] Mustache
[ ] Nunjucks
[ ] Pug
[ ] React
[ ] Twig
[ ] Vue
[ ] Other - please specify below

## Extending Fractalite (for developers)

#### Does the plugin model make sense to you? Any questions/queries about it?

#### Are there customisations that you'd like to make that you think might not be possible in the current plugin system implementation?

#### Does the Adapter system implementation make sense you you?

## Other

#### Is there anything missing from the prototype that currently exists in v1 and that you think should be part of the core of any future versions (i.e. not implemented as a plugin)?

#### Any other comments/suggestions/ideas?
